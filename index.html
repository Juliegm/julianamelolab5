                <p> Welcome! My name is Juliana Melo and this is my portfolio website.<br> I do graphic design, UX design, fashion, photography, etc. Check out my gallery if you want to see my work.<br> I am always willing to take on a new challenge and create something to exceed expectations.</p>
                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> I am currently studying interactive design at Lesley University.<br>
                    I am located in the Greater Boston Area, but I work well virtually too!<br>
                    My experience falls into the Adobe Suite,<br>
                    but I have dabbled in:</p> 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Music</li>
                    <li>Fashion</li>
                    <li>Film Production</li>
                    <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> Some of my past projects are:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Logo creation for Third World Manga</li>
                    <li><a href="https://theumbrellaarts.org/go-out-doors-neighbors"> Go Out Doors - Medford, MA</a></li>
                    <li>Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility - Medford, MA</li>
                    <li>Murals at Medford High School</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Why Smokey?</h3>
                <img src="smokey.png" alt="a stuffed animal of a raccoon named smokey" width="50%">
                <p> The name "Smokey" comes from one of the names of my stuffed animals (which is a raccoon).<br> This name holds meaning to me and I have created a lot of work revolving around this stuffed animal.<br> When it came to my brand name, I could not think of a more perfect name to describe my art style: nostalgic, meaningful, and innovative.</p></div>
